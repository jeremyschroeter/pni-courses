To create a new figure with a preset number of axes, we can use ``plt.subplots(m, n)`` which will return two arguments: the figure and a numpy object array [in the shape of (m, n), or just (m,) for a column of plots, or just (n,) for a row of plots] containing each axes object (``fig, axs = plt.subplots(m, n)``).
